# ERX Grab Info.
This script grabs various troubleshooting commands off ERX routers and uploads the
output to Juniper's TAC.

It has hard coded commands that are always run but can also take in a list of commands in
the 'commands.txt' file.

It gathers this information for all routers listed in the 'router_list.txt' file.
